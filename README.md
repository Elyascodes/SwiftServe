This project is to develop a computerized system to help restaurant personnel
coordinate their activities and improve their services, and for the management to
track business growth and create future plans.
The goal of this project is to introduce automation in privately owned restaurants,
that is, small- to-medium sized establishments. Typical problems restaurant
personnel are facing include:
• Coordination of their work activities
• Anticipating and handling periods of low/high Customer traffic
• Recognizing trends early enough to take advantage of bestsellers or abandon
the flops.
• Lowering operating costs, and increasing efficiency/productivity and profits
This project is to computerize restaurant operations so that all information pertaining
to customers’ orders and staff activity will be conveniently shared and stored over
the restaurant’s intranet. Hosts will be able to view table status with a click of a button.
The wait staff will be able to enter the customers’ orders quickly and efficiently and
then have them delivered electronically to the kitchen. The kitchen staff will be able
to view the incoming orders and notify the proper wait staff when the food is ready.
Busboys will be able to view real-time floor status allowing them to know which tables
are clean, dirty, or occupied.
